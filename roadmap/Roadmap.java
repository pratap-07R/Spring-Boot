/*
1. INTRODECTION TO SPRING BOOT 
    -> what problem it solved 
    -> its feature and advantage

2. SETTING UP INITIAL SPRING BOOT PROJECT 
    ->  Understand layared architacture 

3. UNDERSTAND "MAVEN" , "POM.XML" AND "GRADLE" STRUCTURE A BIT 

4. SPRING BOOT ANNOTATIONS
    -> @springBootApplication
            => this component use only one time in one project and only in main file 
            there are three work of this component 
            1.@Configration
            2.@EnableAutoConfigration
            3.@ComponentScan

    -> @Controler
    -> RestControler
    -> @RequestMapping
    -> @GetMapping, @Postmapping, @PutMapping
    -> @DeletMapping
    -> @AutoWired
    -> @component
            -> if any class have "@Component" then this annotaion bring that class 
            that means class is automatically registerd in Spring bean
            note = you can use this annotation everywhere like class, interface, method, field and function 
            etc.
            this component bring this class in IOC container

    -> @Service
    -> @Repositary
    -> @ComponentScan
    -> @Configration
    -> @Value
    -> @Qualifier
    -> @Profile
    -> EnableAutoConfigration
    -> @Entity
    -> @Transactional
    -> EnableCaching
    -> Async
    -> EnableScheduling etc

5. UNDERSTAND ABOUT Dependency injection and Beans

6. Spring boot Data Access
    -> spring JPA
    -> spring JDBC
    -> Query method

7. Restful api with spring boot

8. spring boot  Data Access
    -> authentication and authorisation

9. Spring Boot logging

10. Spring Boot exception halding

11. Spring boot Interceptor

12. Spring Boot Scheduling

13. Spring Boot Caching

14. Spring Boot Unit testing
    ->Mockito

15. Microservice topic with spring boot
    ->introduction to microservices

    -> service discovery using eureka
        -> microservice registring
    ->tracing the request through many multiple microservices
        -> Sleuth and Zepkin
        -> Sleuth we can attach the trace id with request 
        -> Zepkin help to visualize the trace 
    ->Spring Boot Profile
        -> Diffrent properties based on environment

    -> Spring Cloud Configure Service 
        -> it's a configuration managment
    
    -> Comunication between diffrent microservices 
        -> Sync
        -> Async
    
    -> API Gateway

    -> Circuit Breaker 

    -> CQRS (command query resposibility segregation)

    -> deployment and Containerization
        -> creating executable JARs and WARs
        -> Deploying to docker container 
        
16. BUILD PROJECT
